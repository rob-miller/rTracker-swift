  - moved to macbook pro, though not ssd yet.
  - after refactoring and migrating svn repository, privacy subview working again
  - fixed bug in re-ordering valobjs in a tracker, must check if toRow > array count
  - bug in fn defn, somehow not updating ep ids? ... should add to updateVORefs, recheck also fn setup fix for crash 13/01

02 feb 2011
  - can draw privacy view, tictacview
  - shifted line drawing routine defns to gfx.h
  - added this file to scm
  
--- check in ---


02 mar 2011
  - set, change privacy val all in place, not yet used by tracker display
  
--- check in ---

11 mar -plane to uk-
  - initial export xls working, can open file and write data for each tracker and valobj
  - privacy view restriction implemented for both tracker and value level
  
--- check in ---

21 Mar 2011
  - switch to xcode 4
  - instead of .xls implement .csv
  - moved export button from configTList to useTracker when save not pending
  - minor refactoring to fix 'analyze' issues

22 Mar 2011
  - refactored so access of vo.value triggers [vos update] causing function update, result string set
  - initial csv output working, need to check formatting for input

23 Mar 2011
  - testing, minor bug fixes

24 Mar 2011
  - found bug where fn ep not set to default after load, refactored to make vos' handle clean and set default for optdict
  - optdict defaults now handled in voState objs
  - added voState update(), only active for fn to re-calc .value on read

25 Mar 2011
  - factored out doc, db path creation to (new) rtracker-resource.m
  - option on del tracker to just del data
  - added CSVParser class from Matt Gallagher
  - csv input working -- can't yet save/restore schema
  - default privacy = 1 or can't differentiate priv=0 / not found on load csv
  - TrkrData store min privacy level for date valobjs
  - trying to fix flicker on updatetableview; fixed choice ok, slider broken

26 Mar 2011
  - reverted flicker changes (*check in more often!!*) except for choice 
  - show historical actively would not have enable checkbox on slider, choice; why not? changed

--- check in ---

26 Mar 2011
  - rationalize min/max/big/default privacy values. min for tictac setting is MINPRIV+1

28 Mar 2011
  - flicker fix is to not re-alloc vo displays constantly; fixed messed up slider to get spurious val=0 actions on table reload data
  - changed table reloadData for val changed to just reload fn cells
  - tweak display of slider value for checkbox dis/enable
  - choice value +1 so disabled=0, all selections are positive value
  - voNumber startwithlast picks previous entry by current tracker date, not just last by date
  - start cleaning up NSLog's - need #if debug control

30 Mar 2011
  - tracked down problem in slider to check for useVO on [update], caused wipe of data to set useVO
  + need to clean up either enableVO/disableVO everywhere, or get rid of unused checkbuttonusevo

--- check in ---

  - fixed a memory leak - setVtypes
  + need way to control debug NSLog()s but only option seems to be #if DEBUG wrappers...

31 Mar 2011
  - converted all NSLog to #if DEBUG... controlled 

--- check in ---

09 April 2011
  - error because choice value +1 => not voDisplay'd correctly : added getSegmentIndexForValue routine
  --> bug appearance was all subviews buggered after segmentedControl set to invalid index
  - further complexity: UIControlEventValueCHanged gen'd when val set, not just when user activates -- but slider not this way!
  - privacy cancel from setpass triggered toptf resignfirstresponder, same as setp -> set pass to ""; fixed by rewrite setp, cancelp
  - assuming not null autoscale (= not default) meant errors in graph scale - fixed -- TODO: search for more of these

10 April 2011
  - fixed problem shrinking choice buttons, width was reset when style set.  TODO: seg control needs to be centered in subview in this case

--- check in ---

13 April 2011
  - fixed crash on delete new vo in new tracker - tdb=null
  - fixed bug where kybd notification listen turned on/off in configtvobjvc viewDid(Un)load -- switched to viewWill(Dis)Appear -- so was handling in 2 places
  - moved keyboardIsShown to rtracker-resource so just 1

--- check in ---

13 April 2011
  - fixed bug not clearing text field for number entry if val == @""

14 April 2011

  - fixed bug using ngmin/ngmax not gmin/gmax to display graph min/max in configvo  ??

05 May 2011
  - configTVO: tfDone sets activeField=nil, if not nil when tf_finishEditing then [tfDone:activeField] (fix tap next field not saving changed val)
  - voNumber: typo in setOptDictDflts, was setting nswll not nswl
  - voState: typo in (super) setOptDictDflts, was setting autoscale=dflt if graph==nil (fix autoscale not being saved, was actually set dflt after load)
  - voState:transformVO_num - fixed bug reading autostate, again assumed @"0" would test correctly as !autoscale
  - voChoice:segmentedControl - same test error on shrinkb
  - voTextBox:segmentChanged,voGraphSet - same test error on tbhi,tbni,tbnl
  - voTextBox:segmentChanged - release picker view so gets rebuilt (fix bugs on people, history pickers incl crash on switch)
  - added graphTrackerV:doDrawGraph controlling [drawRect] action, so graph not redrawn for return to utc

  - tbox linecount set maxVal to at least YTICKS to get int vals on y axis labels
  - clean y axis for non-numeric entries

20 May 2011
  - added processingTfDone flag for voChoices and configTVObjVC so tfDone/ctfDone (see 18 may, 05 may) can process multiple events without recursing inadvertently

 - located sample tracker files, next step loading ...

23 february
 - fixed ? multiple entry on refreshView() due to skipped name
 duplicate _in.plist; used flag for lock, nonatomic, race vulnerable

16 june 2012
 - working on constant in function
 - changed 'delta' to 'change_in'

 - fn constant, text field and label appear/hide on pick 'constant';
 scroll on keyboard appear not sufficient

20 june 2012
 - fix keyboard scroll to not include toolbar height so toolbar not
 shown
 - crash if change value type then cancel out .. actually bug is
 change value type, go into config for that type, done, cancel -- val
 type has been changed

21 june 2012 
 - added tmp(Vtype,Vcolor,VGraphType) to private addValObjController
 interface, plus stashVals() and retrieveVals methods to better
 support cancel out
 - back to constant, need work on logic because fn1arg expecting arg
 but inline const already there... also need to go back to calcFnVal
 because of change to bound constant on both sides by token -- needed
 to make deleting const robust

22 june 2012
 - problem was not logic but had 'constant' in wrong place in picker
 list
 - add btn downs keyboard
 - updateFnTitles hides constant tf after wiping array
 -> constant initial implementation seems to work.

--- commit ---

04 july 2012
 - constant code messes up previous fns; re-work so symbol defines
 don't change; probably need to do a version change on fns so can add
 more 1-arg, 2-arg etc. operators one day?
 - float constants not staying, get truncated - change load string
 from db was getting values as ints, now double

05 july 2012
  - mileage fn calc not respecting 'tank full', add "and val <> 0 and
  val <> ''" to selection of start date endpoint

07 july 2012
  - added rtfn_version symbol to support later changing available
  functions

  - db, fn, cfbundle, build count all stored for each tracker on
  create or save if not present already.
  - test on iOS 6.0 / xCode 4.5b2
  - allow calc fn if ep0=0 (first entry) and ep0 is entry or nil

--- commit ---

08 july 2012
  - if needed, version info written to tracker db immediately on load
  - restructure so sampleTrackers is real subdir, not copied

  in Info.plist
  - submitted as 1.0.7
  
--- commit ---

11 sept 2012
  - csv reader will now accept 'date only' timestamps, sets time to
  00:00:00

... nice if it would scroll to top for scroll bars as not visible and
freezes...

20 oct 2012
   - fixes for iphone 5
     - new default screen image
     - group table background color deprecated (fixed in xib)
     - fix 'Application windows are expected to have a root view controller at the end of application launch' with setRootViewController: in rTrackerAppDelegate.m

     - above helped with detecting rotation but not there yet...

03 nov 2012
   - removed code to check version >= 5 on 'will rotate', graph shows now
   - some race condition (?) on presenting graph vc, changed viewDidAppear() to call super before becomeFirstResponder...  nope.... Ah! depends on rotate left or right..

   -- unable to set background color on gtXAxV, gtYAxV, gtVONameV (gtVoNameV not used?)
   - remove punctuation chars from end of date string for x axis label, us region setting

04 nov 2012
   todo for ios6 -- see release notes esp uikit
     - re-work rotation code ?
     - check auth to access addressbook and handle better
     -view(did|will)unload now deprecated
     - ensure setting rootviewcontroller where was addSubview'ing
     -- problem with pushing vodataedit viewcontroller / nav controller
     -> pushnavigationitem instead?

06 nov 2012
   - vodataedit problem was with xib file, see 
     		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12434937

07 nov 2012
   - replaced ios6 deprecated uiviewcontroller calls, suspect need to re-enable if ios5
   - still no solution for left/rigt rotation differences

20 nov 2012
   - finally solved left/right landscape issue, was 'full screen at start' flag in MainWindow.xib -- found because looking for issue with bottom buttons not working.
   - changed behaviour so rotating upside down and on to landscape does not return to normal view
   - put ios 5 checks back in so works on ios5 devices.  4.2 no longer supported, need to test for 4.3

21 nov 2012
   - removed graphTracker.xib
   - commit because think most things working for ios6 except drawing graphs
 
--- commit ---

++ working on graph not drawing problem
   - problem is change in rotation calls -- old ones not being called, so doDrawGraph flag not gettting set.
   + still problem with graph geometry on 6.0

23 nov 2012
   - solved graph geometry problem by removing ios5 hack to modify bounds

   - working on .rtrk file support:
   -- created method tlist:updateTID(old,new) which moves existing tracker with tid=new out of way and updates existing tracker with tid=old to be tid=new
   -- changed tlist:fixDictTID to use this instead of modify dict
   -- working on loadTrackerPlistFiles to update existing tracker on load plist with existing name
   TODO: ?  change filemanager usage to use defaultFileManager see

   - added jumpMaxPriv, restorePriv in rootViewController so privacy is non-issue when loading rtrks

   - setReminders:
   -- revert to no time window for delay days/weeks/months as cannot distinguish 'started and in window' from 'already done so wait another (delay)'
   -- if random < start, set to start + delta/2

   - move sounds out of 'sounds' subdir, into Resources top level -- notification sounds working again on phone
   - add more sounds
   - problem with 'ping' sound -- eventually sorted with 'ad hoc' distribution, install via iTunes - replace app bundle like app store install
   -- gen for ad hoc release, use different (not app store) certificate / distribution profile
   -- add to library in iTunes (file menu), then drag app icon to iPhone menu (from app icon can right-click -> get info and see update date)
   -- wait for app icon on iphone to update 

22 june 2014
   - confirm version on app store has problem of not finding sound files, so does not play on notification event
   - timesSquare calendar with color days by 1 ordered valObj
   -- still some problem with privacy pulling out dates that shoudn't

23 june 2014

   - set to v 1.1.9, prep for release

   - added 'if not RELEASE, do not delete .rtrk on email' so can gen .rtrks from simulator

15 aug 2014
   - removed 'one last chance' fn reload from db if fnArray empty on voFnDefnStr -- caused problems for del btn when deleting 0th item
   -- added (refactored) reloadEmptyFnArray in voDrawOptions so fnArray reloaded from db on entry if array empty
   - added 'voOptDictStash' to configValObj so cancel out of configValObj restores options (esp freps and fnarray) as were on entry 

18 sept 2014
   - working on having correct launch screen sizes for all devices - launchScreen.xib for ios8 and later
   - min supported now ios6 (iphone 3gs, 4th gen ipod touch)

23 sep 2014
   - switch to fixing ios8 keyboard scroll error asap -- yet another superview count for ios8! only problem in useTracker
   - oops graph view generation now fast enough (?) that do not swap width and height at startup (ios8)
   - release as 1.1.10

05 oct 2014
   - add launch screens for different devices
   
09 oct 2014
   - enable file encryption on databases  SQLITE_OPEN_FILEPROTECTION_COMPLETE

15 oct 2014
   - fill out icons for different devices (universal app)
   - set 'toldAboutSwipe' in appDelegate if responding to notification but do not synchronise -- just want to avoid requester

28 oct 2014
   - implemented 'temp tracker data' file save, load, remove -- hopefully solve problem of losing unsaved data when leave/return to app

02 nov 2014
   - add safety 'temp tracker names' file parallel with 'temp tracker data' -- names array must match valueNames, or delete files and return false
   - highlight voTVEnabledCell and voTVCell where need to work on to set cell width for different hardware screens
   
27 nov 2014
28 nov 2014
   - working on background size for tableviews in bigger devices .. useTrackerController looks right and matches initial loaded image, rootViewController not right...
29 nov 2014
   - problem was selecting wrong (landscape) background image name because orientation returns 'unknown' when just starting up ... now some issues around cell lines

30 nov 2014
   - now trying to get rid of lines between cells - esp unused cells at end .. only rootview not useTracker...
   -- got it!  MainWindow.xib still had tableview defined -- so two table views; removed
   - getLaunchImageName does not know about all models (iphone 6's) .. also wrong for ipad2 (non-retina ipad)

03 dec 2014
04 dec 2014
   - got all launch images correct for ios 7,8 -- still not named right for iphone 6+
   - not getting simulator working for 6...

10 dec 2014
   - tested on Sam iPhone 5 with iOS 8.1.1, does not allow / suggest notifications as user reported
   
12 dec 2014
   - added code to enable notifications under 8.1.1 -- not yet tested on Sam's phone but expect ok
   - Database info reports if all notifications disabled in System Preferences
   - work on LaunchImage code BUT at startup ios7.1 orientation unknown, when is known cannot seem to refresh tableView background
   - progressing on useTrackerController display full width, but have crash now in ios 7 but not 8 -- utc viewDidLoad

13 dec 2014
   - fixed ios 7 crash -- setting maxLabel to 1/3 screen for bigger screens reulted in non-int coordinate somewhere, set to int and no crash
   - fixed view problem on reloading launchImage - was that tableview still had old frame
   - voDataEdit - lose xib; get frame width from key window;
   - privacy password set up fucked up
   - iOS 7 crash came back...

14 dec 2014
   - concluded will not support earlier iOS versions, current minimum will go to 7 (or maybe 8 if can't sort current 7.1 problem)
   - got it! add -(void)loadView {  self.view = [UIView new]; }      // Ensure that we don't load an .xib file for this viewcontroller  [ after changing from .xib to programmatic view ]
   - figured out problems with xibs resizing - remove red 'fix' bars, don't add them
   - worked out main problem with seeing ppw view, need to re-work geometries

15 dec 2014
   - switch all .xibs to current Xcode, iOS - autolayout etc. re-work start

16 dec 2014
   - remove separate date/time pref as date picker has resolution now [ oops, did not notice cannot set year now .. but can scoll back to previous year ]
   - after many hours playing, got date picker view satisfactory with autolayout - see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20864823/springs-in-auto-layout-distribute-views-evenly-with-constraints-in-xcode-5
   -- (1) anchor end objects; (2) spacer views between, all with width (height) equal to each other, leading/trailing (top/bottom) set to 0
   - fix deprecated sizeWithFont -> [string sizeWithAttributes:@{NSFontAttributeName: [UIFont systemFontOfSize:17.0f]}];  [ use ceilf( )  on width, height results because result may be fractional ]

17 dec 2014
   - on creating replacement nib was unable to link referencing outlets because new xib does not know about class;
   -- select file's owner, command-option-3 ( -> 'identity inspector'), set class to relevant string (addTrackerController)
   - finished(?) addTrackerController xib init instead of programmatic setup
   - updated certificates  ** note on updating provisioning profiles, do NOT delete any profiles, just revoke expired signing certs in member center, and request new from xcode (preferences / accounts / details)
   - xib updated for addValObjController

18 dec 2014
   - got background image showing through for addTracker and addVaObj controllers ( spacer views not hidden / clearColor, addTracker worked when did not set background for tableview but set to clearColor)
   - completed addValObjController xib update on code side
   - completed notifyReminder, notifyReminderVC2 xib updates
   - cleared ios7 change warnings on trackerObj
   
19 dec 2014
   - clearing warnings
   -- NSFontAttributeName:self.myFont -->  drawAtPoint:tpos withAttributes:@{NSFontAttributeName:self.myFont,NSForegroundColorAttributeName:[UIColor whiteColor]}
   -- [str drawInRect:self.currRect withFont:self.myFont lineBreakMode:NSLineBreakByClipping alignment:NSTextAlignmentCenter] -->
   ---
       NSMutableParagraphStyle *paragraphStyle = [[NSMutableParagraphStyle defaultParagraphStyle] mutableCopy];
       paragraphStyle.lineBreakMode = NSLineBreakByClipping;
       paragraphStyle.alignment = NSTextAlignmentCenter;
       [str drawInRect:self.currRect withAttributes:@{NSFontAttributeName:self.myFont, NSParagraphStyleAttributeName: paragraphStyle}];
   ---
   - cleared all ios7 update warnings!
   - graphs not labelled - suspect drawAtPoint withAttributes needs color?

20 dec 2014
   - yes on withAttributes:NSForegroundColorAttributeName, corrected above, corrected throughout
   - status bar showing through graph title appears to be ios7 bug, not there in ios8 .. except for iPads
   
23 dec 2014
   - have working fix for privacy views; not pretty, but same size for all devices. will fail on large keyboards....
   - removed ppwV.xib as does not seem to be used
   - check on deleteFileAtPath to avoid iOS error message
   - tried to add 'default enabled' to slider but can't work out how to work with 'visited tracker but no change' action
   - added 'swipe left to exit' for all views except useTrackerController (which is already swipe for previous entry -- can't get swipeUp to leave tracker to work)
   - tweaked trackerlist table size so bottom entry accessible

24 dec 2014
   - added split 'enabled cell' (slider and multichoice) titles if contain '|' character
   - fixed problem for larger displays, specifying 'autoresizingmask' for utc cells causes them to autoresize after initial rendering!

---commit ---

27 dec 2014
   - graph y-axis labels format without decimals if step > 2
   - fixed various width problems for vo config fields

   -- oops, makes it so cannot specify action - catch in viewWillDisappear
   - fix choice button width for shrinkbutton=true
   - enabled cells now use dynamic font like other cells

28 dec 2014
   - changes to make db access thread safe:
   -- recalculateFns now has testAndSet lock
   -- trackerObj.sql removed, local NSString *sql everywhere and as argument to all tObjBase db routines
   -- @synchronized(self) around all tObjBase db routines
   - tweaked mimetypes, now can open in google drive and dropbox but convoluted - may have worked before but rTracker not 'top level' choice
   - tweaked fn defn windows for bigger devices
   - added optional decimal places to voNumber, -1 for 'auto'
   - added demo tracker load and versioning support - not tested, demo tracker not done

   - addTrackerController call toggleEdit:segcEditTrackerEditItems to confirm table editing and segmented control in agreement

10 jan 2015
   - cancel from addValObjController wiping vo.optDict by overwriting with voStashDict - but stashDict only created if edit dict; fixed, only noticed if saved or causes crash for textbox with linecount opt because graphTypes array different
   - make 'search position' lines in graph dashed
   - make current vo line,bar in graph wider
   - add emojis to titles for sample trackers
   - shift graph title 140 units to right to avoid status bar bleed through on pre-iOS 8.1.1

11 jan 2015
   - set NSFileProtectionComplete flag after all file writes -- oops not needed
   - enable data protection in capabilities in xcode, entitlements on dev portal for both(?) app IDs -- seems to activate data protection app-wide, so all files protected automatically

    - submitted as 2.0.0

--- commit ---

18 jan 2015

   - added alert to explain why privacy value reset if user tries to set tracker/value to privacy below 1 or above current privacy level
   - remove emoji from 'Edit this tracker to see how it works' in demo tracker
   - refactored call to setup of addValObj controller
   - bugfix: Maciej problem - handle row out of bounds for addvalobj from didSelectRowAtIndexPath -- green '+' does not go this way, but does if select 'add another item to track' bottom row
   + should disable select row to edit valobj but seems convenient - just makes edit items redundant
   - release as 2.0.1
   
08 feb 2015
   - bugfix: reduce vertical content compression priority for notifyReminderVC2 datepicker and sound picker, make equal height - iPhone 4s could not access 'sample' button or toolbar buttons

   - change to 'red arrow' for activated reminded tracker
   - ready to release as 2.0.2

12 sep 2015

todo: make csv split date and time columns so excel can handle — need to read in old version 

todo: replace all export gui stuff with share menu and maybe airdrop
todo: add 'no graph' as graph type and lose 'draw graph' checkbox

+ add -[n] entries thing
+ add entry_count as a fn piece -- count of entries over range, so avg could be sum()/entry_count

# privacy.swift Analysis Notes

## Purpose & Role
Legacy privacy controller - minimal functionality, provides basic tictac view management

## Key Classes/Structs/Protocols
- privacy: NSObject subclass with basic privacy view management
- Global privacyValue variable (singleton pattern)

## Important Methods/Functions
- `getValue()`: Returns current privacy value
- `setPrivacyValue(_:)`: Sets privacy value
- `displaySetter()`, `hideSetter()`, `toggleSetter()`: Basic view animations

## Dependencies & Relationships
- Legacy implementation - most functionality moved to privacyV.swift
- Used alongside privacyV for comprehensive privacy management

## Notable Patterns & Conventions
- Uses deprecated animation methods (`beginAnimations`, `commitAnimations`)
- Simple transform-based animations
- Global singleton pattern for privacy value

## Implementation Details
- **NO BUTTONS TO UPDATE**: This file has no UIButton creation
- Contains only view animation and state management
- Very minimal implementation compared to privacyV.swift
- Uses basic CGAffineTransform for view positioning

## Current Issues & TODOs
- **NO ACTION REQUIRED**: No iOS 26 button updates needed in this file
- Consider whether this class is still needed given privacyV.swift functionality

## Recent Development History
- e41ceb5: files from Swiftify (original conversion from Objective-C)

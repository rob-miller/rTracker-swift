# graphTrackerVC Analysis Notes

## Purpose & Role
Legacy landscape-mode graph view controller for displaying tracker data as time-series graphs with date marking and tap-to-navigate functionality.

## Key Classes/Structs/Protocols
- graphTrackerVC - Main landscape graph view controller class
- Implements UIViewController, UIScrollViewDelegate
- Contains graphTrackerV for actual graph rendering

## Important Methods/Functions
- buildView() - Constructs the graph interface and marks selected dates
- viewWillAppear() - Updates graph markings when view appears
- gtvTap() - Handles tap gestures on graph for date selection
- viewWillTransitionToSize() - Manages rotation between portrait/landscape

## Dependencies & Relationships
- Uses DatePickerResult from datePickerVC.swift for bidirectional date communication
- Contains graphTrackerV for actual graph rendering
- Connected to useTrackerController as parent for date navigation
- Works with trackerObj for data access

## Notable Patterns & Conventions
- Landscape-only orientation for graph display
- Bidirectional date communication via DatePickerResult
- Touch handling for date selection on graph
- Integration with portrait mode tracker for seamless navigation

## Implementation Details
- **Date Marking**: Uses DatePickerResult to mark specific dates on graph display
  - Receives date via `dpr?.action == .goto` when opening from specific tracker date
  - Sets vertical line marker at selected date position using `gtv?.xMark`
  - Updates `xAV?.markDate` for axis labeling
- **Touch Navigation**: Tap handling sets new date and returns to portrait tracker
  - Single tap: Sets `dpr?.action = .goto` with selected date
  - Double tap: Cancels selection (`dpr?.action = .goto` with nil date)
- **Graph Integration**: Contains graphTrackerV instance for actual graph rendering
- **Parent Communication**: Uses parentUTC reference to useTrackerController

## Current Issues & TODOs
- ✅ RESOLVED: DatePickerResult integration with modern enum actions
- ✅ RESOLVED: Bidirectional date communication with useTrackerController
- Graph display is legacy system - modern Charts system exists in Classes/charts/

## Recent Development History
- 2025-09-26: **DATE PICKER MODERNIZATION**
  - Added `var dpr: DatePickerResult?` property for date communication
  - Updated buildView() to mark dates when `dpr?.action == .goto`
  - Updated viewWillAppear() to refresh date marks with enum syntax
  - Modified tap handling to use `.goto` enum action instead of DPA_GOTO constant
  - Added import comment referencing DatePickerResult from datePickerVC.swift
  - Restored full bidirectional date communication functionality
- 4fde8ee: rm dprslt.swift (consolidated into datePickerVC.swift)
- 2e64587: un/hide trackers and valueObjs
- c0d44b0: implement no graph as graph option at addValObj level
- cf325cc: improve Y-axis labels for vot_choice
- 68f30e6: graph xaxis labels accurate
- fa84c89: improve graph within safeAreaInsets

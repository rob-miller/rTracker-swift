# save Command

## Purpose
Create a versioned save file documenting the current work session's main focus and most recent developments

## Usage
```
/save [focus text]
```

When you want to save your current progress and context for future sessions, this command will:

- Identify the main theme/focus of the current work session (or use provided focus text)
- Document the most recent and important changes
- Create a versioned save file in `.claude/saves/save.N.YYYY-MM-DD-MainTheme` format
- Focus on actionable context rather than historical details
- **Explicitly include any unfinished todo lists from the current session**
- **Highlight or focus on specific content when focus text is provided**

## Parameters
- **focus text** (optional): Any text after 'save' to specify what should be highlighted or focused on in the save file. This text will be used to:
  - Override automatic theme detection with user-specified focus
  - Emphasize particular aspects of the current work
  - Guide what content gets prioritized in the save file
  - Help with targeted context restoration

## Process
1. Analyze recent file modifications and changes made in current session
2. Identify the primary work theme (e.g., "iOS 26 button modernization", "HealthKit data cleanup", etc.)
   - **If focus text provided**: Use focus text as primary theme and emphasize related content
   - **If no focus text**: Auto-detect theme from recent work patterns
3. Document key files modified and their current state
4. **Capture any active TodoWrite lists with pending/in_progress items**
5. Note any immediate next steps or pending issues
6. **When focus text provided**: Add a "Focus Highlights" section emphasizing the specified content
7. Create descriptive save file: `save.N.YYYY-MM-DD-MainTheme` (sequential number, date, theme with dashes)

## Save File Format
```
# Save [N] - [Date] - [Main Theme]

## Current Work Focus
[Primary objective and current progress]

## Focus Highlights
[Only included when focus text provided - emphasizes the specified content areas]

## Key Files Modified
- [filename]: [brief description of changes and current state]
- [filename]: [brief description of changes and current state]

## Unfinished Todo Lists
[Complete reproduction of any active TodoWrite lists with status]
- ‚úÖ [completed task]
- üîÑ [in_progress task]
- ‚è≥ [pending task]

## Immediate Next Steps
- [actionable items for next session]
- [pending issues or decisions needed]

## Context Notes
[Any important context that would help resume work efficiently]
```

## Examples
```bash
/save                              # Auto-detect theme and create standard save
/save XIB removal progress         # Focus on XIB-related changes and progress
/save button styling patterns      # Emphasize button implementation work
/save HealthKit integration issues # Highlight HealthKit-specific problems
```

## When to Use
- End of productive work sessions
- Before switching to completely different areas of the codebase
- When you want to preserve current context for later resume
- Before taking breaks from the project
- When you want to emphasize specific aspects of your work (use focus text)

## Note
Focuses on current/recent work rather than comprehensive project history. Designed for quick context restoration when resuming work. When focus text is provided, the save file will prioritize and highlight content related to that focus area.

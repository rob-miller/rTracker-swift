# trackerChartPieChart.swift Analysis Notes

## Purpose & Role
Extension of TrackerChart that implements pie chart functionality. Creates circular charts showing proportional data distribution. Now supports both single-source mode (detailed categorical breakdown) and multi-source mode (proportional comparison across multiple data sources).

## Key Classes/Structs/Protocols
- Extension of `TrackerChart` class
- No additional types defined - uses parent class structures
- Utilizes `pieChartSources[4]` array for multi-source support

## Important Methods/Functions
- `setupPieChartConfig()`: Creates UI with 4 source selection buttons following time chart pattern
- `generatePieChartData()`: Main data processing method with dual-mode logic (single vs multi-source)
- `renderPieChart()`: Main rendering method with mode-aware display logic
- `determineRecentDataSegment()`: Recent data detection (single-source mode only)
- `toggleNoEntryInPieChart()`: Toggle "No Entry" visibility (single-source mode only)
- `drawRecentDataIndicatorLine()`: Draws recent data indicator (single-source mode only)

## Dependencies & Relationships
- Extends `TrackerChart` base functionality
- Uses `fetchDataForValueObj()` and `fetchChoiceCategories()` for data retrieval
- Supports VOT_BOOLEAN, VOT_CHOICE, VOT_NUMBER, and VOT_FUNC value object types
- Follows time chart pattern for multi-source UI and data management
- Integrates with `pieChartSources` array in TrackerChart class

## Notable Patterns & Conventions
- **Dual-Mode Operation**: Single-source (detailed) vs multi-source (comparative) modes
- **Source Dependency Rules**: Source 1 required, sources 2-4 optional and dependent on source 1
- **Mode-Specific Features**: Recent data indicator and "No Entry" toggle only in single-source mode
- **Consistent Color Assignment**: Uses `generateConsistentColors()` for multi-source mode
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Multi-source adds new functionality without breaking single-source behavior

## Implementation Details
- **Single-Source Mode**: Shows detailed breakdown of values within one data source (original behavior)
- **Multi-Source Mode**: Shows proportional contribution of each source to combined total
- **Data Aggregation**: Sums values for numeric types, counts entries for boolean/choice types
- **UI State Management**: Disables sources 2-4 buttons when source 1 not selected
- **Recent Data Integration**: Only functions in single-source mode to avoid confusion
- **Color Strategy**: Multi-source uses consistent spectrum colors, single-source uses type-specific colors
- **Privacy Integration**: Respects privacy settings when fetching data from all sources

## Current Issues & TODOs
- **Testing Required**: Multi-source functionality needs testing with real data sources
- **Edge Cases**: Verify behavior when sources have different value types or ranges
- **Performance**: Monitor performance with large datasets across multiple sources

## Recent Development History
- **2025-08-22**: Major enhancement to support up to 4 data sources for proportional comparison
- **2025-08-22**: Added mode-aware rendering with single vs multi-source display logic
- **2025-08-22**: Implemented source dependency rules (source 1 required, 2-4 optional)
- **2025-08-22**: Disabled recent data indicator and "No Entry" toggle in multi-source mode
- **898658c**: Enhanced pie chart by removing 0% segments and empty category name segments for cleaner display
- **848f8d8**: Major refactoring to separate chart functionality into individual files

# privacyV Analysis Notes

## Purpose & Role
Privacy view controller that provides graphical password protection for the app

## Key Classes/Structs/Protocols
- privacyV: Main privacy view controller class
- Handles privacy screen display and password entry

## Important Methods/Functions
- `init(parentView:)`: Initializes privacy view with dynamic positioning and bottom bar detection
- `showPVQ(_:)`: Handles showing/hiding privacy view with proper transform positioning
- `showing` setter: Complex state machine managing privacy view visibility states
- `togglePrivacySetter()`: Public method to show/hide privacy interface
- `lockDown()`: Secures app by hiding privacy settings and resetting privacy level
- `dbTestKey(_:)`, `dbSetKey(_:level:)`: Database operations for privacy patterns
- `resetPw()`: Resets password and privacy state

## Dependencies & Relationships
- Called from RootViewController via _privacyObj initialization
- Works with privacy.swift for core privacy logic

## Notable Patterns & Conventions
- Dynamic positioning based on parent view dimensions and safe areas
- Uses CGAffineTransform for slide animations instead of frame manipulation
- Lazy loading pattern for UI elements (clearBtn, configBtn, etc.)
- State machine pattern for managing view visibility modes
- Privacy screen covers app content when activated

## Implementation Details
- **RESOLVED**: View positioning issue on iOS 26 - now uses dynamic positioning
- View starts positioned below visible area (y = parent.height) for clean animation
- Bottom bar height calculated from safe area insets, tab bar, or toolbar
- Transform-based animations for smooth slide up/down transitions
- Automatic view reattachment if detached from superview during animation
- Width adapts to parent view width instead of hardcoded 320px

## Current Issues & TODOs
- **COMPLETED**: Button sizing and positioning - now uses intrinsicContentSize and clipsToBounds = false
- **COMPLETED**: ppwV positioning to attach to keyboard properly - fixed updatePpwvPosition() logic
- **COMPLETED**: Button overlap issue - separate lock button created with proper show/hide logic implementation
- **COMPLETED**: Privacy navigation buttons (next/prev) - Fixed direction detection using accessibilityIdentifier instead of currentTitle
- **COMPLETED**: Dynamic height calculation - replaced fixed 171pt with calculated 242pt height
- **COMPLETED**: Button clipping issue - removed view bounds clipping constraints
- **COMPLETED**: Updated button creation to use new .uiButton extension pattern
- **COMPLETED**: All privacy buttons now use unified rTracker-resource button creation system
- **COMPLETED**: Tap-outside-to-dismiss functionality with keyboard dismissal and ppwV protection
- **COMPLETED**: ppwV z-order issues - now properly appears on top of privacyV
- **COMPLETED**: ppwV positioning timing issue in PVCONFIG state - fixed state assignment order

## Recent Development History
- 2025-01-15: iOS 26 Privacy Button Fixes Session
  - Fixed button sizing using intrinsicContentSize instead of sizeToFit()
  - Added clipsToBounds = false to prevent button clipping
  - Created separate lockBtn property and added to view hierarchy
  - Updated privacy view height from fixed 171pt to dynamic 242pt calculation
  - Updated ppwV positioning logic to fix keyboard attachment issues
- b952b22: Comment tweaks - final cleanup
- 275d422: make db ops return values not optional
- 4493fc6: priv value too small for 100
- 3b5e0fc: xpriv, out2in, more on priv view position - major positioning fixes
- 01827d8: privacyV visible on start, register notifications
- ea97c39: privacy not visible at bottom on startup - initial iOS 26 issue

## Last Updated
2025-01-15 - Tap-Outside-to-Dismiss and ppwV Positioning Fixes:
- **Tap-Outside-to-Dismiss**: Implemented comprehensive overlay system with keyboard dismissal and ppwV protection using hit testing
- **ppwV Z-Order**: Fixed ppwV sliding behind privacyV by adding bringSubviewToFront() calls in show methods and privacyV state transitions
- **ppwV Positioning**: Fixed timing issue where updatePpwvPosition() used wrong state by moving _showing assignment before position calculation
- **Overlay Management**: Smart overlay positioning that protects ppwV interaction while allowing background dismissal
- **State Cleanup**: Enhanced cancelp() method with complete target removal for clean event handling

Previous session - Privacy Button Refactoring and Navigation Fixes:
- **Button API Update**: Updated all button creation calls to use new .uiButton extension pattern
- **Navigation Fix**: Fixed privacy navigation buttons (next/prev) using accessibilityIdentifier instead of currentTitle
- **ppwV Positioning**: Fixed updatePpwvPosition() to properly position password view above privacy view/keyboard
- **Lock/Setup Logic**: Completed show/hide logic for separate lock and setup buttons using iOS 26 approach
- **Code Consistency**: All privacy buttons now use unified rTracker-resource button creation system

Previous session - iOS 26 Privacy Button Fixes:
- Fixed critical button sizing and clipping issues affecting iOS 26 SF symbol buttons
- Replaced sizeToFit() with intrinsicContentSize for proper button dimensions
- Created separate lock button to resolve setup/lock button overlap
- Updated privacy view to use dynamic height (242pt) instead of fixed 171pt
- Improved ppwV positioning logic for better keyboard attachment

Previous: 2025-09-18 - iOS 26 positioning issues resolved, debug logging removed, view positioning now dynamic based on bottom bar detection

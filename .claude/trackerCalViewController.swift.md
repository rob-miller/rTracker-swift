# trackerCalViewController Analysis Notes

## Purpose & Role
Calendar view controller for displaying tracker data entries on a calendar interface, allowing users to view historical data by date

## Key Classes/Structs/Protocols
- trackerCalViewController: Main calendar view controller class

## Important Methods/Functions
- loadView: Sets up the calendar view and data
- [Need to analyze to identify other key methods]

## Dependencies & Relationships
- Imports UIKit for view controller functionality
- Depends on trackerObj for data access via tracker property
- Uses TimesSquare calendar component (TSQCalendarViewDelegate)
- **References DatePickerResult and DatePickerAction** from datePickerVC.swift
- Used by useTrackerController for calendar-based date selection

## Notable Patterns & Conventions
- Follows project naming convention with lowercase class name
- [Need to analyze code style patterns]

## Implementation Details
- **Action Communication**: Uses DatePickerResult for bidirectional communication with parent controller
  - Sets `dpr?.action = .cancel` when user cancels/leaves calendar
  - Sets `dpr?.action = .gotoPost` when user selects a date (midnight-based)
  - Property: `var dpr: DatePickerResult?` (updated from dpRslt?)
- **Calendar Integration**: Implements TSQCalendarViewDelegate for TimesSquare calendar
- **Data Flow**: Receives tracker instance and dpr from useTrackerController via property injection

## Current Issues & TODOs
- ✅ RESOLVED: DatePickerResult integration completed
- ✅ RESOLVED: Modern enum action handling (.cancel, .gotoPost)
- Need to analyze loadView function to understand date set handling
- User wants additional DBGLog messages for date set availability and reasoning

## Recent Development History
- 2025-09-26: **DATE PICKER MODERNIZATION**
  - Updated `var dpr: dpRslt?` to `var dpr: DatePickerResult?` for type safety
  - Modified action assignments to use modern enum syntax (.cancel, .gotoPost)
  - Added import comment referencing DatePickerResult definition in datePickerVC.swift
  - Updated Objective-C comments to reflect new DatePickerResult type
- 90bdfac: revert colorSet, colorName re-ordering, make static array not always newly allocated
- 63080ae: calendar: alert swipe to exit, update return to useTracker
- fc588d2: add swipe between search results, add modifiable search, fix calendar highlight entries
- 6a89e39: changes to get compiled, some runtime error fixes
- e41ceb5: files from Swiftify (original conversion)

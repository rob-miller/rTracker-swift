# ahViewController.swift Analysis Notes

## Purpose & Role
SwiftUI view controller for selecting and configuring HealthKit data sources. Provides UI for choosing data source, units, frequency, time filters, and aggregation methods for Apple Health integration.

## Key Classes/Structs/Protocols
- `ahViewController`: Main SwiftUI view for HealthKit source configuration
- `UnitSegmentedControl`: Segmented control for unit selection
- Uses `rtHealthKit.shared` for HealthKit data management
- Integrates with `HealthDataQuery` configurations

## Important Methods/Functions
- `selectedConfiguration()`: Finds the currently selected HealthKit configuration
- `shouldShowNewControls()`: Determines visibility of frequency/time filter/aggregation controls
- Various computed properties for UI sections: `dataSourcePicker`, `unitSelectionArea`, `hoursMinutesSection`, etc.
- `navigationInfoButton`: Info button in navigation bar (recently moved from body)

## Dependencies & Relationships
- Imports SwiftUI, HealthKit
- Depends on `rtHealthKit` singleton for configurations
- Uses `HealthDataQuery` for data source definitions
- Callback pattern via `onDismiss` closure

## Notable Patterns & Conventions
- State management with @State properties for all UI controls
- Conditional UI sections based on selected data source type
- Info sheet pattern for contextual help
- Picker style uses WheelPickerStyle for main data source selection
- Toggle controls for boolean options (hrs:mins format, previous day)

## Implementation Details
- Supports hours:minutes display format for minute-based units
- Previous day switch affects data attribution timing
- New frequency/time filter/aggregation controls only shown for high-frequency data sources
- Unit selection enforced for sources that require units
- Info buttons provide contextual help via sheet presentations

## Current Issues & TODOs
- UI layout recently reorganized to move elements up and consolidate info button
- Navigation info button only appears when data source has information available
- Layout optimized for compact spacing - picker and high frequency options now use minimal space
- Fixed vertical alignment - content now top-aligned instead of center-aligned
- No known issues with current implementation

## Recent Development History
- cf8775f: Removed ahAvg functionality
- 46e0e36: Updated aggregationType usage, removed ahAvg
- 75a7491: Working on high/low frequency data differentiation
- 79f71e4: Improved hrs:mins display switch handling
- Recent focus on cleaning up averaging controls and improving high-frequency data handling
- LATEST: Moved UI elements up, removed redundant "Choose data source (i)" line, moved info button to navigation bar

## Last Updated
2025-08-03: Fixed vertical alignment issues - changed from full padding to horizontal+minimal top padding, constrained picker height to 120px, added Spacer() to force top alignment. Previous day and high frequency options now appear at top of screen instead of being pushed down.

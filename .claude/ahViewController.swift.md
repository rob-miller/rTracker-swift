# ahViewController.swift Analysis Notes

## Purpose & Role
SwiftUI view controller for selecting and configuring HealthKit data sources. Provides UI with category tabs (Metrics/Sleep/Workouts), workout category filtering, data source selection, units, frequency, time filters, and aggregation methods for Apple Health integration.

## Key Classes/Structs/Protocols
- `ahViewController`: Main SwiftUI view for HealthKit source configuration
- `UnitSegmentedControl`: Segmented control for unit selection
- `SampleFilter`: Enum for filtering by data category (metrics/sleep/workouts)
- `WorkoutCategoryFilter`: Enum for filtering workouts by category (cardio/training/sports/etc)
- `HelpInfoButtonView`: UIViewRepresentable for custom info button styling
- Uses `rtHealthKit.shared` for HealthKit data management
- Integrates with `HealthDataQuery` configurations

## Important Methods/Functions
- `selectedConfiguration()`: Finds the currently selected HealthKit configuration
- `effectiveMenuTab(for:)`: Helper that checks for menuTab overrides vs sampleType defaults
- `filteredConfigurations`: Returns configurations filtered by current tab and workout category
- `ensureSelectionMatchesFilter()`: Ensures current selection is valid for active filters
- Various computed properties for UI sections: `sampleTypeSelector`, `workoutCategorySelector`, `dataSourcePicker`, etc.
- `infoButtonRow`: Info button positioned in dedicated row instead of navigation bar

## Dependencies & Relationships
- Imports SwiftUI, HealthKit, UIKit
- Depends on `rtHealthKit` singleton for configurations
- Uses `HealthDataQuery` for data source definitions with MenuTab enum support
- Callback pattern via `onDismiss` closure
- Integrates with `rTracker_resource.createHelpInfoButton()` for UIKit button styling

## Notable Patterns & Conventions
- State management with @State properties for all UI controls
- Conditional UI sections based on selected data source type
- Info sheet pattern for contextual help
- Picker style uses WheelPickerStyle for main data source selection
- Toggle controls for boolean options (hrs:mins format, previous day)

## Implementation Details
- **Menu Tab System**: Uses MenuTab enum with effectiveMenuTab() to support menuTab overrides vs sampleType defaults
- **Category Filtering**: Segmented control filters between Metrics/Sleep/Workouts using SampleFilter enum
- **Workout Category Filtering**: Horizontal scrollable pill buttons for workout subcategories (Cardio/Training/Sports/etc)
- **Dynamic Selection Management**: ensureSelectionMatchesFilter() maintains valid selections when switching categories
- **Initialization Logic**: Sets initial sampleFilter and workoutFilter based on selectedChoice parameter
- **Info Button Integration**: Custom UIViewRepresentable wrapper for consistent info button styling
- Unit selection enforced for sources that require units
- Info buttons provide contextual help via sheet presentations

## Current Issues & TODOs
- MenuTab override system implemented and working properly
- Category-based filtering provides better organization for large number of workout types
- Info button moved from navigation bar to dedicated row for better accessibility
- Styled "Update HealthKit Choices" button with capsule border design
- Workout category pills use smooth animation transitions
- No known issues with current implementation

## Recent Development History
- **Latest Changes**: Added comprehensive workout support and menu organization system
- **Menu Tab System**: Implemented MenuTab enum (Metrics/Sleep/Workouts) with override capability
- **Workout Categories**: Added extensive workout type support with category filtering
- **UI Reorganization**: Category tabs, workout filters, and improved info button positioning
- **New HealthKit Types**: Added Sleeping Wrist Temperature and Mindful Minutes support
- **ahPrevD Enhancement**: Improved previous day data handling with proper date shifting

## Last Updated
2025-09-28: Major overhaul with MenuTab system, comprehensive workout support, and improved UI organization. Added category filtering (Metrics/Sleep/Workouts), workout subcategory filtering, MenuTab override system with effectiveMenuTab(), and enhanced info button integration. Supports hundreds of workout types organized by category with proper menuTab placement control.

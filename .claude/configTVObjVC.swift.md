# configTVObjVC Analysis Notes

## Purpose & Role
Configuration view controller for editing valueObj properties - manages UI for configuring tracker value objects

## Key Classes/Structs/Protocols
- configTVObjVC - Main view controller class for value object configuration
- Uses XIB file for UI layout (ConfigTVObjVC.xib) - NEEDS TO BE REMOVED

## Important Methods/Functions
[To be determined during analysis]

## Dependencies & Relationships
- Inherits from UIViewController
- Works with valueObj instances for configuration
- Connected to ConfigTVObjVC.xib file for UI

## Notable Patterns & Conventions
- Part of the tracker configuration system
- Uses XIB-based UI (needs migration to programmatic)

## Implementation Details
- Currently relies on XIB file for UI layout
- XIB file contains mainly a scrollview according to user
- Needs conversion to programmatic UI creation

## Current Issues & TODOs
- ✅ RESOLVED: XIB dependency removed - now uses programmatic UI creation
- ✅ RESOLVED: Navigation bar, toolbar, and scroll view created programmatically
- ✅ RESOLVED: Auto Layout constraints properly configured
- Code now fully independent of XIB files
